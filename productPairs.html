        /* We have N products, numerated 0 to N - 1. These products belong to several categories (e.g. food, music, clothes, ....).

        Unfortunately, we lost information about each product's category. However, we still have information about certain pairs of products which belong in the same category.  For instance, (1, 3) means that products 1 and 3 belong to the same category.

        We want to recommend pairs of these products, but in such a way that two products in a pair do not come from the same category. Ultimately, we are interested to understand in how many ways can we make such a recommendation.

        We are given a number of products, N, and a list of pairs that denote products belonging in the same category. Let's calculate in how many ways we can make our recommendation! */
